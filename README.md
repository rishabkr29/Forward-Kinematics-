# Forward-Kinematics

1. The robot has four links, each connected using a revolute pair ( like a door hinge)
2. The axis of each joint is perpendicular to the previous joint. 
3. The lengths of the links -â€™ Lâ€™ is 1m each.

## ðŸ§® Forward Kinematics Explanation

Each joint introduces a **rotation** followed by a **translation** along the X-axis (link direction). These are represented using `4Ã—4` homogeneous transformation matrices.

The overall transformation from the base to the end-effector is:
